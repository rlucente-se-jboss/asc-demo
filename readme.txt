These scripts simplify creating a clean, never-been-run installation of
BPMS 6 with the latest rollup patch applied.  The scripts also set up a
properly patched directory of runtimes for JBDS to use for both Drools
and jBPM.

To use this, make sure the "dist" directory contains the following files:

    jboss-bpms-installer-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1.jar
    jboss-bpms-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1-deployable-generic.zip
    jboss-brms-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1-deployable-generic.zip
    BZ-1174359.zip  (the BPMS 6.0.3 rollup 2 patch)
    BZ-1174357.zip  (the BRMS 6.0.3 rollup 2 patch)

The auto.xml script should also be edited so that the <installpath/>
element matches the intended installation location.  This script will
install BPMS 6 in the same directory as these scripts.  I currently
target $HOME/asc-demo/bpms so the installed directory is actually
$HOME/asc-demo/bpms/jboss-eap-6.1

After that, to remove an installation, simply type:

    ./clean.sh

And to install the software, simply type:

    ./install.sh

The fully patched runtimes for JBDS are located at:

    Drools Runtime:  $HOME/asc-demo/runtimes/jboss-brms-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1-deployable-generic/jboss-brms-engine
      jBPM Runtime:  $HOME/asc-demo/runtimes/jboss-bpms-6.0.3.GA-redhat-1-deployable-generic/jboss-bpms-engine

The install.sh script adds additional users for BPMS.  You can modify
these as needed.  The auto.xml.variable file contains the password for
the bpmsAdmin user.
